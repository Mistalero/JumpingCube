basic plugin for Retroshare

This is currently a simple paint+chat plugin for retroshare.
It uses some code from several other plugins, including electrons paintchat plugin.
All data is sent using the "example" class - "encoded" as a string.
Expect mistakes, my C++ is very rusty, and im new to both QT and retroshare.


## Quick Start:

If you know what you are doing, do that!

otherwise

### Make a new user
```
  useradd retrotester
```
### inspect then run the build and test script (KDE)
```
  cat testit.sh
  ./testit.sh
```
### Exit the new instance of retroshare when done testing
